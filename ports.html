            <h1>USB type A</h1>
                <p> USB Type-A connectors, or simply Type-A connectors, 
                    are one of the most common USB connectors. As such, 
                    they are sometimes also called Standard A connectors. 
                    It is the standard rectangular-shaped connector that is
                     commonly found on one end of nearly every desktop computer, 
                     laptop, media player, TV, game console, etc.

                     If your laptop or desktop computer has a USB port 
                     (where you can plug in USB devices), it will most likely be a 
                     USB Type-A port. Note that most modern Apple laptops (Macs) 
                     dont have USB Type-A ports.
