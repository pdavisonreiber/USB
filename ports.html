            <h1><b>USB Type C</b></h1>
            <p> Developed to support devices with a smaller, thinner and lighter form factor. Type-C is slim enough for a smartphone or tablet, yet robust enough for a laptop computer.
                In fact, many new laptops have eliminated USB-A and RJ45 Ethernet ports and offer USB-C as
                the only port for video, network, data transfer and charging. This has prompted other
                protocols, including Thunderbolt™ 3, DisplayPort, MHL, and HDMI, to adopt USB-C as their
                standard source connector.
                Alternate Modes allow the data pins on a USB Type-C connector to carry other types of
                signals. For example, DisplayPort Alt Mode (also referred to as DP Alt Mode) allows a USB-C
                cable to connect a DP-enabled laptop or tablet directly to a TV or computer monitor with a 
                USB-C port.The USB-C Type 2.1 specification (announced May, 2021) increases the power capacity 
                of cables and connectors from 100W to 240W, making it possible to power and charge larger, 
                power-hungry devices such as 4K monitors, e-bikes and gaming laptops.</p>

                <h2><i><b>Uses of Type C</b></i></h2>
                <p>To understand USB data transfer rates, you need to know a little about the design of the
                USB-C connector. A USB Type-C connector has four pairs of pins known as "lanes" that transmit
                (TX) and receive (RX) data (see highlighted pins in Figure 1 below). USB 3.0 (5 Gbps) and USB
                3.1 (10 Gbps) use one TX lane and one RX lane, depending on the orientation of the connector. 
                USB 3.2 takes advantage of all four lanes to achieve a 20 Gbps data rate.

            <h1><b> USB type A</b></h1>
            <p>USB Type-A connectors, or simply Type-A connectors, are one of the most common USB connectors. 
                As such, they are sometimes also called Standard A connectors. It is the standard rectangular-shaped 
                connector that is commonly found on one end of nearly every desktop computer, laptop, media
                 player, TV, game console, etc. <p> 
                <img src="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/USB-Type-A.jpg" alt="USB-A"> </p>
                 If your laptop or desktop computer has a USB port 
                 (where you can plug in USB devices), it will most likely be a USB Type-A port. 
                 Note that most modern Apple laptops (Macs) don’t have USB Type-A ports.</p>
